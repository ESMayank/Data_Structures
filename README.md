## Introduction

In the field of computer science, data structures and algorithms are foundational concepts that every programmer should understand. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions.

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various data structures and algorithms, accompanied by explanations and examples where applicable. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer brushing up on core concepts, you'll find something useful here.

## Languages

The implementations in this repository are written in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Java


Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages as well!

## Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures currently implemented in this repository:


- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, etc.)
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure has its own directory containing its implementation along with relevant documentation.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Fibonacci Sequence, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms (Knapsack Problem, Job Scheduling, etc.)
- String Algorithms (Pattern Matching, Edit Distance, etc.)

Like data structures, each algorithm has its own directory containing its implementation along with relevant documentation.

## Contributing
